#  ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Itsyourdriver!
I'm a content creator and web developer from the united states. I am open to trying new things and enjoy contributing to projects that I can work on.

## âœ¨ Some of my current projects are: 

https://driver.fyi/ - A project site containing minecraft datapacks and links to some of my random stuff! Site is being reworked so the current web design is not representitive of my work.

https://shiba.ga/ - A Multi-use discord bot containing multiple nice commands including polls, suggestions, 8ball, and a couple others and is open source! I plan on adding more to it in the future.
