#  ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Itsyourdriver!
I'm a content creator and web developer from the united states. I am open to trying new things and enjoy contributing to projects that I can work on.

## âœ¨ Some of my current projects are: 

https://driver.fyi/ - A project site containing Minecraft data packs and links to some of my random stuff! Currently slowly turning it into a car/automotive news/blog site, all of that is not public for now, the goal is to have no ads while creating a great reading experience.

https://shiba.driver.fyi/ - A Multi-use discord bot containing multiple nice commands including polls, suggestions, 8ball, and a couple others and is open source! I plan on adding more to it in the future.

Stuff I'm working on right now:

Driver's Serpent's Hand - A customizable Serpent's Hand plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory. Currently a work-in-progress and will be released within the next few weeks. (THIS PLUGIN WILL BE FOR NORTHWOODAPI/NWAPI, NOT EXILED)

Driver's Utils - Adds multiple bindable item commands for your players to use, also adds a disableable guard captain system. Picks one guard at the start of a round to be a captain. Some other utilities as well. Also a work in-progress, is mostly done, same with the serpent's hand plugin.
